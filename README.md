The CS Society is hosting this challenge to motivate you to make a habit out of programming while concurrently lending your hand in building a library of handy solutions that could help others in need.

This is open to complete beginners, and a list of resources have been compiled to get you rolling: [21 Days of Code Resources](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1MvR449gHhKe0jkpLwJi9X080wpb3nNwr)

To track your progress, fork this repo: [21 Days of Code](https://github.com/cs-ashoka/21-days-of-code)

#### Why should you do this?
These problems are cunningly crafted to help you flex those brain muscles to conquer the most important skill of all: googling, or more philosophically, self-learning.

Also, this challenge will help you overcome the monkey of procrastination by developing a healthy habit of coding. Through religiously sticking to your commitment of learning in tidbits daily, you will learn/get better at coding in next to no time.

#### How will this work?
**tl;dr:** Choose questions, code, submit the problem with a working solution, check out the leaderboard, don’t stress yourself out, enjoy the process and find yourself learning.

Every day, 4 questions plus 1 featured question will be posted on the repository. You can choose to solve all the questions, or only the questions that interest you, as long as you code for at least one hour every day. Submit Pull Requests with the code that you have solved. Only working solutions will be merged. You can code in any language you want (maybe even check out esoteric languages like brainfumk, or Folders they’re cool!)

There will be a leaderboard which will keep track of the number of commits that have been accepted.

Time yourself coding. Take breaks in between. Check out [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) (or [Animedoro](https://deepstash.com/idea/77397/whats-the-animedoro-technique), if that’s your thing!). Do whatever your heart says as long as it is not against the sacred law of an hour of coding every day (without burning yourself out, stay hydrated). Remember, consistency is key.

Feel free and remember, you are always welcome to get in touch with [Rithik](mailto:rithik.kumars_ug24@ashoka.edu.in), [Vaibhav](mailto:vaibhav.sharma_ug24@ashoka.edu.in), [Archisman](mailto:archisman.dutta_ug24@ashoka.edu.in), [Jigyanhsu](jigyansu.rout_ug24@ashoka.edu.in), [Karnav](karnav.popat_ug24@ashoka.edu.in) for help. Keep in mind that we are only here to guide you with a beacon, and not take you hand-in-hand to the destination.

If emails feel too old-school or just isn’t your favorite place, you could drop a text on Instagram to [Rithik](https://www.instagram.com/not.rithik/), [Archisman](https://www.instagram.com/_archismandutta_/), [Vaibhav](https://www.instagram.com/vaibhav.sh14/), [Jigyanshu](https://www.instagram.com/iamjr15/) or [Karnav](https://www.instagram.com/kkkarnav/) (but do note that we are all cs nerds without social lives so we don't really check insta often :p)

Please do not text/spam the CS society via email/Instagram for help with particular problems! Use these points of contact instead!
Once again, dig through this goldmine: resources Vaibhav has unearthed. (Note: You can only access these from your Ashoka ID)

Rules:
* Code for at least an hour every day for the next 21 days.
* However, you will not be disqualified if you miss a day or two, but try your best remain consistent and not miss the challenge two days in a row or more.
