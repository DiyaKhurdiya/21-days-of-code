### Steps to increase the likelihood of success

- Check out other [resources](https://www.100daysofcode.com/resources)
- (Optional, but highly recommended) Fork [this Github repo](https://github.com/cs-ashoka/100-days-of-code) and commit to the Log daily. Follow the instructions in the repo.
- Follow 100DaysOfCode Twitter Bot that retweets all the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It’s a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. Thanks @amanhimself for creating it!
- Important: Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It’s also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (probably more :) ) right away.
- If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me (see info below)
